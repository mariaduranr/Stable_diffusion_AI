    "# API from Python Scripts\n",

    "\n",
    "In modules 4.0 and 4.2 we used the python package requests to interact with the webui API as well as the Civitai API.\n",

    "If you start the API with the command `./webui.sh --api --device-id=2`  on lambda1, then you logout of lambda1, your server process will end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script start.sh starts the API in the background so that it continues to run after you log out of lambda1. There is also a script ping.sh that checks to see if the API is running. Some of you are setup to run those scripts, but I think some are not.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Log in to lambda1 with ssh.\n",
    "* Run the command ping.sh\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If ping.sh runs and return `API needs to be started`, then you can execute the command `start.sh`, and after a minute or two ping.sh will tell you that `API is available`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also start the API in the background with the command `nohup ./webui.sh --api --device-id=1` when you are in your stable-diffusion-webui directory. Using this command or running start.sh will run your API in the background so it will not die when you logout.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. My API was running, so when I executed `ping.sh` the result was `API is available`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I then executed the command `ps -ef | grep launch.py` and we see that my API has process ID \\3320252.  We also see that there are three other users with running APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I executed the command `kill 3320252` to stop my API\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now `ping.sh` shows that the API needs to be started.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Executing the `ps` command now shows the three others running, but not mine."
