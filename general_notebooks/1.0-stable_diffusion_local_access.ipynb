    "    Stable Diffusion is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for image generation that was released open source on August 22, 2022 by StabilityAI. Stable Diffusion has risen in popularity due to it being open source, because it is free, and because it can be run on an ordinary computer, and several other image generation tools have been built on top of Stable Diffusion models. \n",

    "* Text-to-Image Generation: Enter prompts, ideally both positive (aspects you do want) and negative (aspects you don't want), and receive a generated image. \n",
    "    * This is possible in many different styles, including realistic, semi-realistic, anime, game assets, landscapes, etc.)\n",

    "    \n",
    "* Image-to-Image Generation: Use existing images as inspiration to create new images or transform them. \n",
